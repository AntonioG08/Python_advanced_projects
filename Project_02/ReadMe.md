Second project divided in 2 different applications:

- Graficar_funciones
- Indice_marginacion

The first application is a code that graphs a function that the user passes,
and we can view it, zoom in and out, by using the 'Pygame' library.

The second application is a code that retrieves data from the INEGI of Mexico,
process it and stores it in a DataBase using SQLite 3. Afterwards, a menu is
shown and the user can choose a type of graph and what information he wants 
see.
